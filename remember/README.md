# REMEMBER

Do you ever forget things? I do. This is a small utility to help you remember things for later.

# Usage

Simply type the thing that you would like to remember after the name of the command.

```
remember pick up groceries // no output, it has been remembered
```

To recall the thing that has been remembered, simply type remember with no arguments

```
remember // => pick up groceries
```
